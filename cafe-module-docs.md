## üöÄ Onboarding: From Registration to Dashboard

The journey for a new cafe is designed to be simple and secure.

1.  **Initial Registration**: A cafe owner signs up using their phone number and creates a password.
2.  **Profile Setup**: Upon first login, the owner is directed to a dedicated setup page. Here, they must fill in essential details like cafe name, location, and upload initial photos. This step is mandatory before accessing the main dashboard.
3.  **Admin Verification**: Once the profile is submitted, it enters a **pending verification** state. The CafeChain admin team reviews the submission and, within 24 hours, approves the cafe.
4.  **Activation**: After approval, the cafe becomes **Active**. It will now appear in the user app, and the owner gains full access to the Cafe Dashboard and all its features.

    3.  An OTP is sent to the **customer's registered email**, which they provide to you. Enter the OTP to securely complete the transaction.

    * **Manage Events**: A "View All" button leads to a full-screen view of all past and upcoming events.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

* **Multi-Factor Login**: Cafe login is secured with a password (JWT) and a one-time password (OTP) sent to the owner's registered email for critical actions.
* **Customer-Verified Redemption**: Points can only be deducted after the customer verifies the transaction via an OTP sent to their email.
* **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints for redemption are rate-limited to prevent fraudulent activity or spam.
* **Mandatory Admin Approval**: No cafe can go live on the platform without manual verification by a CafeChain administrator, ensuring the legitimacy of all partners.
